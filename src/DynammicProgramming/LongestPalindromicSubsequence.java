/*
Problem: Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)
Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest subsequence that is also a palindrome.

Key Insight:
- A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
- The LPS of a string is the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between the string and its reverse.

Approach:
1. Reverse the string.
2. Apply the standard LCS algorithm between the original string and its reversed version.
   - If characters match: add 1 to the LCS of remaining parts.
   - Else: take max between skipping one character from either string.
3. Return the length of the LCS â†’ this is the length of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence.

Time Complexity: O(n * n)
Space Complexity: O(n * n)

Note:
- This approach does not find the actual subsequence, just its length.
- Useful building block for related problems like:
    - Minimum insertions/deletions to make a string palindrome
    - Longest Palindromic Substring (different problem!)
